# Purpose
This is the Core project, what needs a history table to store its jobs' histories,
therefore migrations need to be created by either one of the related EFDataSeeder projects
or by generating one migration project manually:

1. Find or set up a startup project (e.g.: your main project)
2. Point to the project where the migrations should be collected, including this package's
   * Check the ```AJProds.EFDataSeeder.Tests.Console``` for some ideas
3. Create & generate the migrations!
