# Purpose
This is the original, default package what works only with [MSSQL](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer). 
It applies the migration of the SeederHistory table in it.

For further info, see https://github.com/bandii/EFSeeder

_This project's name is without the db (MSSQL) suffix, because the initial version of this project used to work with MSSQL only, and
I would like to avoid these heavy changes for now._
